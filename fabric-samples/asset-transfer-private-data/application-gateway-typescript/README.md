# Asset Transfer Private Data Sample

This app uses fabric-samples/test-network based setup and the companion chaincode asset-transfer-private-data/chaincode-go/ with chaincode endorsement policy as "OR('AirtelMSP.peer','JioMSP.peer')"

For this usecase illustration, we will use both Airtel & Jio client identity from this same app
In real world the Airtel & Jio identity will be used in different apps to achieve asset transfer.
